This presentation demonstrates the most recent features of Psyplot, a powerful tool for visualizing climate data on unstructured grids. The utilization of UGRID conventions has become paramount in handling unstructured grids effectively. This presentation demonstrates how psyplot can be used to effectively and straightforwardly to visualize climate data conforming to UGRID conventions, highlighting its role in enhancing the comprehension of spatial and temporal patterns.

Another key focus of the presentation is on the grid-independent extraction of vertical transects in 4-dimensional data, addressing a critical challenge in climate science. I will showcase the new innovative methodologies within Psyplot that facilitate seamless extraction of vertical profiles across varying grid structures, enabling researchers to analyze and interpret climate variables with unprecedented precision. By showcasing practical applications and case studies, the presentation aims to demonstrate the usefullness of psyplot for climate data analysis and model development. Attendees will gain valuable insights into the potential of Psyplot and its role in pushing the boundaries of visualizing climate data on unstructured grids.
